[00:20.94] Breathing in the dark, lying on its side
[00:40.94] 
[00:30.76] The ruins of the day painted with a scar
[00:50.76] 
[00:39.09] And the more I straighten out, the less it wants to try
[01:06.59] 
[01:07.09] 
[00:50.38] The feelings start to rot, one wink at a time
[00:58.50] Oh-oh, forgiving who you are, for what you stand to gain
[01:05.19] Just know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
[01:10.06] When you get out of bed, don't end up stranded
[01:14.14] Horrified with each stone on the stage, my little dark age
[01:43.14] 
[01:29.99] Picking through the cards, knowing what's nearby
[01:53.99] 
[01:39.69] The carvings on the face say they find it hard
[01:48.03] And the engine's failed again, all limits of disguise
[02:14.53] 
[01:59.40] The humor's not the same, coming from denial
[02:07.56] Oh-oh, I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
[02:13.89] I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
[02:19.17] If you get out of bed and find me standing all alone
[02:24.29] Open-eyed, burn the page, my little dark age
[02:46.29] 
[02:48.44] I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
[02:53.40] You know that if it hides, it doesn't go away
[02:58.31] If I get out of bed, you'll see me standing all alone
[03:03.59] Horrified on the stage, my little dark age
[03:24.59] 
[03:17.61] Giddy with delight, seeing what's to come
[03:38.11] 
[03:28.12] The image of the dead, dead ends in my mind
[03:49.62] 
[03:37.90] Policemen swear to God, love seeping from their guns
[03:42.93] I know my friends and I would probably turn and run
[03:47.65] If you get out of bed, come find us heading for the bridge
[03:52.90] Bring a stone, all the rage, my little dark age
[03:57.32] I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
[04:02.32] I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
[04:07.35] If you get out of bed and find me standing all alone
[04:12.32] Open-eyed, burn the page, my little dark age
[04:34.32] 
[04:50.36] All alone, open-eyed, burn the page, my little dark age
